	  <h4> Katelyn Gutierrez </h4>

      <p>Hi I'm Katelyn but i go by katie.
		I am 17 years old who lives in Illinois.
		I am currently in a program called Girls Who Code and we learned many different programing langueages and ley me tell you this I fell in love with this summer program it has been an amazing experience.
		Me personally I decided to do this webaite with my teammates because I've personally have dealt with anxiety, depression, panic attacks(which are just terrible).
		I wanted to creat a website people can come here and just feel safe, connect with others who are struggling with the same problems and ontop of that this a space where I want everyone to feel safe & free to be themselves.

		
		<h4> Evelyn Torres </h4>
		
		<p> I'm Evelyn! You guys can call me Ev or Evie or just Evelyn. 
		I'm 17 going on 18 this October. I'm from Illinois. 
		I run cross country and track and I'm a JROTC head (that's all I ever talk about, and for those of you who don't know, JROTC is Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps.)
		I love talking, so I am extremely glad to be here to talk to all of you guys! I have personally never experienced anxiety or depression, but I have friends who have faced it.
		My friends know that they can talk to me about anything because I'm not one to judge, but rather a person who will try their best to help anyone out when they need someone to talk to.
		So, I hope you all visiting our page will feel free to contact any of us at any time when you need to talk.</p>
		
		<h4> Sajara Magdaleno </h4>
		<p> I am a 16 year old who lives in Illinois. 
		I am currently in a program called Girls Who Code and we learned how to code with many different programming languages.
		My group and I decided to make this website ourselves because we thought it would be nice to see people be able to talk about their feelings.
		I do have family members who have anxiety and it's hard to see them struggle with it because they have no one they can talk to/ no one there to understand what they are going through. 
		I hear my parents talking about my cousin (who has anxiety) sometimes, and my parents say that my cousin is overthinking things and that he needs to relax. 
		I don't think that what they say that he should do will help him because he has tried to 'relax' before, but that doesn't work. 
		I feel like this website can help people, like my cousin, find some peace. 
		I also think that this website can teach people, like my parents, things about mental health.</p>
		
		<h4> Thailyn Gonzalez </h4>
		<p>I'm Thailyn Gonzalez, I usually just go by Thai.
		I'm 16 years old who lives in Illinois.
		Being in High School there are a lot of stress going on, stress over big tests, extra curriculums, friend drama, relationship drama, etc.
		I read an article on 15minutes4me.com about stress' affect on teenagers. 
		They had conducted a study on 4300 stressed out teens, and 61% could handle the stress effectively, the other 39% were diagnosed with depression ranging from mild to severe.
		And in that 31%, 6% had attempted suicide. 
		If I have the capability to create something that can help even a couple people from this, why wouldn't I?</p>
